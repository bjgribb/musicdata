        <p>Danceability describes how suitable a track
        is for dancing based on a combination of musical
        elements including tempo, rhythm stability,
        beat strength, and overall regularity.
        A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.</p>

        <p>Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a 
        perceptual measure of intensity and activity. 
        Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. 
        For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach 
        prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features 
        contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, 
        perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.</p>

        <p>A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the 
        track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the 
        track is acoustic.</p>
